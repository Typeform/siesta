## Developing

### Prerequisites

- Node.js
- Yarn

### Installation

To install the project dependencies:

```bash
yarn
```

Copy the contents of the `.env.dist` file into a new file called `.env`
and fill in the necessary variables with your own variables.

### How to run it
```bash
yarn start
```

### How to run tests
```bash
yarn test
```
### How to distribute
Github actions requires all the package dependencies in the repo to run the JavaScript code.  
We prefer to distribute our code and modules into a single file: ```dist/index.js```. To do that, run: 
```bash
yarn distribute
```

## Usage
### Input Variables:   
```google-credentials```: Mandatory, serialized string of the contents of the credential.json generated by enabling the Calendar API. [More info](https://developers.google.com/calendar/quickstart/nodejs) 
```google-token```: Mandatory, serialized string of the contents of the token.json generated by running [this script](https://github.com/gsuitedevs/node-samples/blob/master/calendar/quickstart/index.js)  
```google-calendar-id```: Optional, Google Calendar ID as returned by the CalendarsList call. [More info](https://developers.google.com/calendar/v3/reference/calendarList/list)  

For more info, don't hesitate to check [action.yml](action.yml).
